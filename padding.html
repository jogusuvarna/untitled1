An article is usually written to spread information, but more than that, it also describes an event, person, experience, etc. It can also be written with the intention of sharing a balanced opinion about a certain topic. Articles are useful sources of information as well as entertainment. In a journalistic point of view, there are quite a few types of articles namely news articles, feature articles, sports articles, editorial articles, and so on. Although these articles use different approaches and have varying standards, the one thing in common about them is that they are based on facts.

An article is a piece of writing usually intended for publication in a newspaper, magazine, or journal. It is usually written intended for a wide audience, therefore it is essential to be able to attract and retain the readers’ attention. However, styles and types for articles have different variations such as straight news, amusing feature stories, opinionated news, and so on. Regardless of the styles and types, there should always be an element of truthfulness to it; it must also contain relevant facts and information to the topic at hand.

In addition, it can either be formal and informal depending on the audience. Since the article could possibly be published in a publication, it must be informative and must be written in an interesting or entertaining manner in order to captivate the readers’ attention and retain their interest. If you look at it in another perspective, an article is in a less formal style than that of a report since their are no needs for graphs, does not use bullet points and sections.
